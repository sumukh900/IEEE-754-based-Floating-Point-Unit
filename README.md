# IEEE-754 Floating Point Arithmetic Units

A comprehensive implementation of IEEE-754 single-precision floating-point addition and subtraction units written in Verilog. These modules provide hardware-level floating-point arithmetic operations with proper handling of normalization, denormalized numbers, and IEEE-754 format compliance.

## Overview

Floating-point arithmetic presents unique challenges in digital design due to the complexity of the IEEE-754 format and the various edge cases that must be handled correctly. This implementation focuses on educational clarity while maintaining functional correctness, making it an excellent resource for understanding how floating-point operations work at the hardware level.

The modules implement the complete floating-point arithmetic pipeline including field extraction, exponent alignment, mantissa arithmetic, normalization, and result formatting. Each step is clearly documented and structured to help students understand the intricate process of floating-point computation.

## IEEE-754 Single Precision Format

Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand the IEEE-754 single-precision format that these modules operate on:

```
Bit 31    Bits 30-23    Bits 22-0
  Sign     Exponent      Fraction
   S       EEEEEEEE     FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```

**Sign Bit (S)**: Determines whether the number is positive (0) or negative (1)

**Exponent (E)**: 8-bit biased exponent with bias of 127. The actual exponent is calculated as E - 127, allowing representation of both very large and very small numbers.

**Fraction (F)**: 23-bit fractional part of the mantissa. For normalized numbers, there's an implicit leading '1' bit, giving effectively 24 bits of precision.

### Understanding Mantissa and Normalization

In normalized floating-point numbers, the mantissa is represented as 1.FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, where the leading '1' is implicit and not stored. This maximizes precision by ensuring the most significant bit is always meaningful. For denormalized numbers (when exponent = 0), the implicit bit becomes '0', allowing representation of very small numbers close to zero.

## Module Architecture

### fp_adder.v - Floating Point Adder

The floating-point adder implements the complete IEEE-754 addition algorithm through several distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Field Extraction**
The module begins by extracting the sign, exponent, and fraction fields from both input operands. This separation allows independent manipulation of each component according to IEEE-754 rules.

**Phase 2: Mantissa Reconstruction**
For normalized numbers, the implicit leading '1' is restored to create the full 24-bit mantissa. Denormalized numbers (exponent = 0) use the fraction directly without the implicit bit, enabling representation of very small values.

**Phase 3: Exponent Alignment**
When adding floating-point numbers with different exponents, the mantissa of the number with the smaller exponent must be right-shifted to align with the larger exponent. This ensures that corresponding bit positions represent the same magnitude.

**Phase 4: Arithmetic Operation**
Depending on the signs of the operands, the module performs either addition (same signs) or subtraction (different signs). The larger mantissa is determined to handle the subtraction case correctly and determine the result's sign.

**Phase 5: Normalization**
After the arithmetic operation, the result may need normalization. If addition produces a carry-out, the mantissa is right-shifted and the exponent incremented. If the result is smaller than expected, left-shifting occurs until the most significant bit is '1', with corresponding exponent decrements.

**Phase 6: Result Assembly**
The final IEEE-754 result is assembled by combining the computed sign, adjusted exponent, and normalized mantissa fraction (with the implicit bit removed).

### fp_subtractor.v - Floating Point Subtractor

The floating-point subtractor leverages the mathematical relationship that A - B = A + (-B). By inverting the sign bit of the second operand, subtraction becomes addition with a negated second operand. This elegant approach reuses most of the addition logic while properly handling the sign manipulation required for subtraction.

The subtractor follows the same algorithmic phases as the adder but with the crucial difference in sign handling. This demonstrates an important principle in computer arithmetic: complex operations can often be reduced to simpler ones through mathematical transformations.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive IEEE-754 Compliance
Both modules handle the full range of IEEE-754 single-precision numbers, including normalized numbers, denormalized numbers, and proper exponent biasing. This ensures compatibility with standard floating-point representations used in processors and software.

### Robust Normalization Logic
The normalization process is critical for maintaining IEEE-754 compliance. The modules include sophisticated logic to handle both overflow (requiring right shifts) and underflow (requiring left shifts) conditions that can occur during arithmetic operations.

### Educational Code Structure
The implementation prioritizes clarity and educational value. Each major operation is broken into distinct phases with clear variable names and comprehensive comments. This structure helps students understand the step-by-step process of floating-point arithmetic.

### Denormalized Number Support
Many educational floating-point implementations ignore denormalized numbers due to their complexity. These modules correctly handle denormalized inputs and can produce denormalized outputs when appropriate, providing a complete IEEE-754 implementation.
